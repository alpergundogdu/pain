# pain
Simple paint app with python-tk

## Instructions

Requires python3. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) first:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

Install dependencies and run:

```
> poetry install
> poetry run python main.py
```

## TODO

- 📄 Add docstrings
- 🧪 Add tests
- ⚙️ Add basic layer support
- 📁 Add a load button
- ♻️ Add save and restore support to canvas (Helps with undo)
- 💾 Add more save formats (Idea: Copy canvas actions in PIL and use PIL to save the image)
- 🖌️ More brushes/tools?
